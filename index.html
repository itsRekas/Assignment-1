The colors? Reviews? Bios for the actors? Behind the scenes photos? Your final site with embedded video should be uploaded and live on your GitHub pages. It should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file. You should incorporate at least one element of interactivity on the page.">

                <p id="video-description">This shortclip highlights the basic petty annoying things that happen to us in life. It shows a boy that is having a bad day and how sometimes he tends to get pissed. He is to go to the office with some stuff and then check them in on the office laptop after which he is to sign in that he is done work and return the box back to the office he took it from. In doing this he tends to have petty problems like fixing the USB into the slot, putting the plug into the socket and even whn he was checking in he hit his toes aside the issue with the door</p>
