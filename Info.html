It should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file. You should incorporate at least one element of interactivity on the page.">

                        <p>This shortclip highlights the basic petty annoying things that happen to us in life. It shows a boy that is having a bad day and how sometimes he tends to get pissed. He is to go to the office with some stuff and then check them in on the office laptop after which he is to sign in that he is done work and return the box back to the office he took it from. In doing this he tends to have petty problems like fixing the USB into the slot, putting the plug into the socket and even whn he was checking in he hit his toes aside the issue with the door</p>

                        <p>In creating this short clip, I drew inspiration from the everyday annoyances and frustrations that we all encounter from time to time. You know, those petty little things that just seem to pile up and make your day a bit more challenging than it needs to be. I wanted to capture the essence of those moments when everything feels like it's going wrong, from struggling to plug in a USB to accidentally stubbing your toe on the door. These are the moments that we can all relate to, the ones that make us laugh at ourselves and the absurdity of it all.</p>

                        <!-- Description of the third checkpoint -->
                        <p>In the production process for this short clip, we aimed to evoke a sense of timelessness by filming in black and white without sound, giving it a vintage aesthetic reminiscent of old silent films. This choice was deliberate, emphasizing the idea that these petty annoyances have existed since the beginning of time. We meticulously planned each scene to capture the essence of everyday frustrations, from the boy's struggles with the USB port to his unfortunate encounter with the door. Through careful editing and attention to detail, we created this art piece</p>

                        <p>Our crew for this project was a tight-knit group of friends who all came together to bring this vision to life. Obed, who's currently on the verge of graduating, lent a hand with various tasks, offering his insights and support throughout the process. Despite not feeling his best, Lincoln, our dedicated videographer, powered through and expertly captured each scene with precision and creativity. Maureen, with her keen eye for detail and storytelling, provided invaluable suggestions that elevated the narrative and ensured we stayed true to the essence of the project.</p>

                        <p> The moral of this short clip is that life's little annoyances and frustrations are universal experiences that everyone faces, regardless of the era. By highlighting these moments in a humorous and relatable way, we are reminded to take these minor setbacks in stride and find the humor in them. Even when things don't go as planned, it's important to maintain a sense of perspective and resilience, knowing that these small challenges are a part of the human experience and can often bring us closer together through shared understanding and laughter</p>
